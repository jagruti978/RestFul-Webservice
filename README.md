# RestFul-Webservice
RESTful Web Service for Women’s Shopping Cart with CRUD Operations and JSON Data Retrieval

## Project Overview

This project is a Women’s Fashion Shopping Cart Web Application that uses a RESTful Web Service to manage fashion products.
The REST API acts as a bridge between the frontend (HTML, JS) and the backend (Java DB) enabling full CRUD operations:

- Create – Add new fashion products

- Read – View all products

- Update – Edit product details

- Delete – Remove products

Data is exchanged in JSON format and displayed in a styled HTML table.

## Technologies Used

Backend: Java, Java DB (Derby)

Databse : MySQL

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Architecture: RESTful Web Service
